# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing! This repository is a personal sandbox for experiments in 2D physics and visualization — contributions are welcome, especially creative ideas and small experiments.

## How to contribute

- Share ideas: open an issue titled "Idea: ..." with a short description and motivation.
- Submit experiments: open a Pull Request for small, self-contained changes or features. Prefer small, well-scoped PRs.
- Report bugs: include steps to reproduce, the command you ran, relevant config, and any traceback.

## Focus areas

- Visualization experiments (rendering techniques, shaders, UI improvements)
- Physics tweaks (integrators, collision handling, performance improvements)
- Mini-games and interactive demos

## Collaboration & help

- If you want to collaborate, open an issue describing the idea and what you can contribute.
- Label issues with `collab` if you are seeking a co-author or pair programmer.
- For quick questions, open an issue or start a short PR with a prototype.

## PR checklist

- Add a brief description and screenshots/GIFs when applicable
- Keep changes focused and documented in the PR message
- Ensure code follows the style in the repository and includes small tests when reasonable

## Code of conduct

This is a friendly, inclusive project. Please be respectful. See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for how to get in touch if you experience issues.
